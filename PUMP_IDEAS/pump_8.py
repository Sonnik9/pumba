# My very first indicator in Pine Script with two alert conditions for trading bots.
# It's based on "Pump Catcher" by @joepegler

# I modified some parts, hopefully improved the usability and enabled alerts, so you can use it to trigger bots like 3commas via webhooks.

# Pump Alerts ðŸš€ attempts to "detect moments of abnormal and accelerating increase in volume" AKA "pumps". Small and big pumps.
# I recommend using it on small timeframes like 1 to 15 min and tinkering with the lookback period as well as threshold values.
# Other than that it's pretty self-explanatory and beginner-friendly.

# Free and Open Source. Let me know how you use it!
